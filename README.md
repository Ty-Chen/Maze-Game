# Maze-Game
The idea comes from the book 《Design Pattern : Elements of Resuable Object-Oriented Software》. That book use a interesting example of a maze game to describe how structure design pattern works, but in the left of the book it drops this example. So I will keep on writing a little game of maze to learn design pattern for all of the 23 types of design pattern and more if they are useful for creating a excellent game.
